            <ul>
                <li><strong>Where I was:</strong> Before i.c.stars, I built my career in physical security. I knew I wanted to break into tech but wasn’t fully sure which path to take. What I lacked was mentorship, guidance, and exposure to the industry. i.c.stars provided me with not only those resources, but also a community that truly wanted to support and uplift people like me. I already had the curiosity, drive, and creativity — what I needed was the opportunity to channel them into a meaningful career in technology.</li>
                <li><strong>Where I am:</strong> Through i.c.stars, I have gained valuable experience in business consulting, technology (coding), and leadership. I strengthened my confidence in public speaking, problem analysis, and developing user-focused solutions. This journey has shaped my career path toward project management and cybersecurity. With the guidance of my program manager, I’ve sharpened my career vision, strengthened my resume, and gained clarity on the roles where I can truly thrive.</li>
                <li style="margin-top:24px;"><strong>Short-term goals:</strong> Sharpen my coding skills, earn my CompTIA certification, and secure an IT Support Specialist role. This path will allow me to combine my leadership, problem-solving, and communication skills to make a meaningful impact.</li>
                <li style="margin-top:24px;"><strong>Long-term goals:</strong> Become a Cybersecurity Analyst or Project Manager, using my foundation in business consulting to eventually lead and inspire teams. Ultimately, I want to create solutions that not only protect organizations but also make a positive difference in people’s lives.</li>
